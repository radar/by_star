Upgrading ByStar
----------------

* ActiveRecord: the `between` method has been deprecated as of version 2.2.0, and will be removed in version 3.0.0.
Please use `between_times` instead.

* Mongoid: the `between` method has been removed as of version 2.2.0, as it conflicts with the native Mongoid `between`
method. Please use `between_times` instead.

* Chronic gem (used for time string parsing) has been removed as a hard dependency for ByStar,
however it is still supported. If you would like to use Chronic with ByStar, please explicitly
include `gem chronic` into your Gemfile.
